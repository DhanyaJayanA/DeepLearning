### DeepLearning
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning (ML), where artificial neural networks—algorithms modeled to work like the human brain—learn from large amounts of data.

#### Transfer Learning: 
  Transfer learning is the method of starting with a pre-trained model and training it for a new — related — problem domain.
